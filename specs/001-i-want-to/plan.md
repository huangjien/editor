# Implementation Plan: Modern Fleet Android App

**Branch**: `001-i-want-to` | **Date**: 2025-09-17 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/huangjien/workspace/editor/specs/001-i-want-to/spec.md`

## Summary
The user wants a modern, fleet Android app for reading novel chapters from a GitHub repository. The app will feature text-to-speech, Bluetooth control, local storage for offline use, and support for multiple languages. The technical approach will be based on React Native.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: React Native (latest stable), TypeScript
**Primary Dependencies**: React Navigation, react-native-paper, react-native-tts, octokit/rest.js, i18next, react-i18next
**Storage**: Local storage (AsyncStorage) for offline caching of markdown files and settings.
**Testing**: React Native Testing Library (unit), Detox (E2E)
**Target Platform**: Android
**Project Type**: Mobile + API
**Performance Goals**: Smooth UI, fast chapter loading, responsive playback control.
**Constraints**: Must be offline-capable. The UI needs to be user-friendly, easy to use, and visually appealing. Must support Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), English, German, Italian, French, Russian, and Spanish.
**Scale/Scope**: Initially, the app will support up to 1000 chapters stored locally.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Library-First Architecture**: Compliant. The app will be structured with reusable components.
- **II. CLI Interface & Tooling**: Compliant. Standard React Native CLI and scripts will be used.
- **III. Test-First Development**: Compliant. Tests will be written before implementation.
- **IV. Cross-Platform Integration Testing**: Compliant. Testing will cover both Android and potentially iOS in the future.
- **V. Observability & Performance Monitoring**: Compliant. Flipper and other tools will be used.
- **VI. Versioning & Platform Compatibility**: Compliant. Versioning will follow semantic versioning.
- **VII. Simplicity & Performance First**: Compliant. The use of local storage and focus on a smooth UI aligns with this principle.

**Structure Decision**: Option 3: Mobile + API

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
Completed.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
Completed.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
