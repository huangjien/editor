# Implementation Plan: Modern Fleet Android App

**Branch**: `001-i-want-to` | **Date**: 2025-09-18 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/huangjien/workspace/editor/specs/001-i-want-to/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

This plan outlines the development of a React Native application for reading and listening to novel chapters from a GitHub repository. The app will be built with TypeScript and styled using NativeWind (a Tailwind CSS-like library). It will feature secure local authentication, background audio playback with Bluetooth controls, and a customizable reading experience, adhering to the project's constitution.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (latest stable)
**Primary Dependencies**: React Native, NativeWind, `react-native-track-player`, `react-native-tts`, `react-native-biometrics`
**Storage**: AsyncStorage for settings and user progress.
**Testing**: React Native Testing Library, Detox
**Target Platform**: Android
**Project Type**: Mobile
**Performance Goals**: Smooth UI (60 fps), responsive playback controls.
**Constraints**: Must handle audio focus correctly. Must be offline-capable after initial content fetch.
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user application, scope limited to the features defined in the specification.

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- **Adherence**: The project will use React Native, TypeScript, and the specified testing libraries, in full accordance with the constitution.

**Structure Decision**: Option 3: Mobile App. The source code will follow a standard React Native project structure.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:

   - All initial `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` markers have been resolved.

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   - Research tasks were completed to define the technology stack for a React Native application using Tailwind CSS (NativeWind).

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`:
   - All decisions and rationales are documented in `research.md`.

**Output**: `research.md` with all `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:

   - `Settings`, `Chapter`, and `User` entities have been defined in `data-model.md`.

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:

   - No external API contracts are needed. The `contracts` directory is created for potential future use.

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

   - Not applicable at this stage.

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

   - Key user flows and acceptance criteria are documented in `quickstart.md`.

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - This step will be performed by the `/tasks` command.

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `/contracts/` directory, `quickstart.md`.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base.
- Generate tasks from the design artifacts (`data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`).
- Create tasks for:
  - Setting up the React Native project with NativeWind.
  - Implementing the data models and state management.
  - Building the UI screens (Landing, Index, About, Content, Settings) using React Native components and NativeWind for styling.
  - Implementing the GitHub service to fetch files.
  - Integrating `react-native-track-player` for audio playback and controls.
  - Integrating `react-native-biometrics` for authentication.
  - Setting up AsyncStorage for persistence.
  - Writing unit and E2E tests for each feature.

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation.
- Dependency order: State Management → Services → Components → Screens.
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (e.g., UI screens can be developed in parallel).

**Estimated Output**: 30-40 numbered, ordered tasks in `tasks.md`.

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan.

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates `tasks.md`)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute `tasks.md` following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute `quickstart.md`, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| (None)    | -          | -                                    |

## Progress Tracking

_This checklist is updated during execution flow_
