# Feature Specification: Modern Fleet Android App

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a modern, fleet android app: it should be able to pull the files from a specified github repo, certain folder(may need to recursive find sub folders). These files are markdown file, are novel chapters. We need a landing page, an index page to list chapters, an about page; and content page to load content of chapter, we can use local text to speech service to play audio; and a setting page to specify github token, repo, branch, content folder, display font, font size, play speed, current play/reading location. Use local identify service to guard this app. This app should response to bluetooth device that connected to the phone, e.g.: play,pause,previous,next etc."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to read and listen to novel chapters from a GitHub repository on my Android device, so I can enjoy my reading anywhere.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the app is launched for the first time, **When** I go to the settings page, **Then** I should be able to input my GitHub token, repository, branch, and content folder.
2. **Given** the app is configured with a valid GitHub repository, **When** I go to the index page, **Then** I should see a list of novel chapters.
3. **Given** I have selected a chapter, **When** I am on the content page, **Then** I should be able to read the chapter content and use the text-to-speech feature to listen to it.
4. **Given** I am listening to a chapter, **When** I use my connected Bluetooth device, **Then** I should be able to play, pause, go to the previous or next chapter.
5. **Given** I am in the settings page, **When** I change the font, font size, or play speed, **Then** the changes should be reflected in the content page.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the GitHub token is invalid?
- What happens when the repository or branch does not exist?
- What happens when the content folder is empty or does not contain markdown files?
- What happens when the device is offline?
- How does the app handle malformed markdown files?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to configure GitHub repository settings (token, repo, branch, content folder).
- **FR-002**: System MUST fetch and display a list of markdown files from the specified GitHub repository folder.
- **FR-003**: System MUST display the content of a selected markdown file.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide text-to-speech functionality for the chapter content.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to control playback (play, pause, next, previous) via Bluetooth devices.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to customize display settings (font, font size).
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to customize playback speed.
- **FR-008**: System MUST have a landing page, an index page, an about page, a content page, and a settings page.
- **FR-009**: System MUST use local identity service to guard the app. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What kind of protection is needed? Biometric? PIN?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST remember the user's current reading/playing location.
- **FR-011**: System MUST support internationalization for the following languages: Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), English, German, Italian, French, Russian, and Spanish.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Chapter**: Represents a novel chapter with content.

- **User**: Represents the app user, with their identity managed by the local service.
