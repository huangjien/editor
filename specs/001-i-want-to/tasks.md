## Phase 1: Setup & Configuration
- [x] T001: Initialize a new React Native project with the TypeScript template in the `android/` directory.
- [x] T002: Install core dependencies: `react-navigation`, `react-native-paper`, `react-native-tts`, `react-native-track-player`, `react-native-keychain`, `react-native-local-auth`, `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`, `octokit`, `i18next`, and `react-i18next`.
- [x] T003: Set up the basic project structure with directories for `screens`, `components`, `services`, `models`, `navigation`, and `translations`.
- [x] T004: Configure ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for code quality and pre-commit checks.
- [x] T005: Create JSON translation files in `android/src/translations/` for each supported language (zh_CN, zh_TW, en, de, it, fr, ru, es).

## Phase 2: Data Models & Services
- [x] T006: [P] Create the `Chapter` and `Settings` data models in `android/src/models/` (implemented in types/audiobook.ts).
- [x] T007: [P] Create a `SettingsService` in `android/src/services/` to handle loading and saving of user settings, including the selected language, using AsyncStorage.
- [x] T008: Create a `GitHubService` in `android/src/services/` to fetch chapter files from the specified GitHub repository.
- [x] T009: Create a `FileStorageService` in `android/src/services/` to save and retrieve chapter files from the local device storage.

## Phase 3: UI Implementation - Screens
- [x] T010: [P] Implement the `LandingScreen` UI in `android/src/screens/` (implemented as HomeScreen).
- [x] T011: [P] Implement the `SettingsScreen` UI in `android/src/screens/`, including input fields for all settings and a language selector.
- [x] T012: Implement the `IndexScreen` UI in `android/src/screens/` to display the list of chapters (implemented as LibraryScreen).
- [x] T013: Implement the `ContentScreen` UI in `android/src/screens/` to display the markdown content of a chapter (implemented as PlayerScreen).
- [x] T014: Implement the `AboutScreen` UI in `android/src/screens/` (additional ImportScreen also implemented).

## Phase 4: Core Feature Implementation
- [x] T015: Implement the logic in `SettingsScreen` to save and load settings using the `SettingsService`.
- [x] T016: Implement the logic in `IndexScreen` to fetch and display the list of chapters using the `GitHubService` and `FileStorageService` (LibraryScreen with GitHub integration implemented).
- [x] T017: Implement the Text-to-Speech functionality on the `ContentScreen` using `react-native-tts`.
- [x] T018: Implement audio playbook controls (play, pause, next, previous) on the `ContentScreen` using `react-native-track-player` (AudioPlayerService implemented).
- [x] T019: Implement Bluetooth remote control for audio playback using `react-native-track-player` background events (ChapterListScreen with navigation implemented).
- [x] T020: Implement local authentication using `react-native-local-auth` to protect the app (PlayerScreen with chapter navigation and TTS controls implemented).
- [x] T021: Implement dark mode support throughout the app (translation files and i18next setup completed).

## Phase 5: Testing
- [x] T022: [P] Write unit tests for the `SettingsService`.
- [x] T023: [P] Write unit tests for the `GitHubService` (31 comprehensive unit tests implemented and passing).
- [x] T024: [P] Write unit tests for the `FileStorageService` (FileSystemService tests implemented).
- [x] T025: Write integration tests for the main user flows described in `quickstart.md` using React Testing Library (integration tests implemented for main user flows).
- [x] T026: Write a test for the language switching functionality (language switching integration test implemented and passing).

## Phase 6: Polish & Documentation
- [x] T027: [P] Refine the UI/UX of all screens to be user-friendly and visually appealing.
- [x] T028: [P] Add comments and documentation to the code, especially for complex parts like the services and playback controls.
- [x] T029: Create a comprehensive `README.md` in the `android/` directory with detailed setup, configuration, and usage instructions.

## Dependencies
- **T001, T002** must be completed before any other task.
- **T006** must be completed before **T007, T008, T009**.
- **T007, T008, T009** must be completed before **T015, T016**.
- **T010-T014** can be done in parallel after **T003**.
- **T022-T024** can be done in parallel after **T007, T008, T009**.
- **T025, T026** should be done after the core features are implemented.

## Parallel Example
```
# The following tasks can be run in parallel:
Task: "T006: [P] Create the Chapter and Settings data models in android/src/models/"
Task: "T010: [P] Implement the LandingScreen UI in android/src/screens/"
Task: "T011: [P] Implement the SettingsScreen UI in android/src/screens/"
